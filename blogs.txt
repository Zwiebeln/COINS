https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2017/10/20/politicization-of-an-already-too-political-foreign-policy/	The presence of so much military brass and I include White House Chief of Staff John F Kelly who arguably is the second most important person in the administration in high national security posts creates the appearance of a decidedly un American Praetorian Guard surrounding a hapless and unfit president That s disturbing enough However the policy and rhetoric coming from these people are also hyper politicized Rather than bringing a discerning strategic sensibility the top level national security officials now operate like political hacks thereby diminishing their own influence  We saw Kelly act as a political attack dog for the president with regard to Gold Star families  We saw CIA Director Mike Pompeo falsely claim that the intelligence community found that Russian interference did not affect the 2016 election This was blatantly false The Post reported  His comment suggested falsely that a report released by U S intelligence agencies in January had ruled out any impact that could be attributed to a covert Russian interference campaign that involved leaks of tens of thousands of stolen emails the flooding of social media sites with false claims and the purchase of ads on Facebook  A report compiled by the CIA and other agencies described that Russian operation as unprecedented in its scale and concluded that Moscow s goals were to undermine public faith in the U S democratic process and help elect Donald Trump  But the report reached no conclusions about whether that interference had altered the outcome an issue that U S intelligence officials made clear was considered beyond the scope of their inquiry  The report also warned against turning CIA analysts into political pundits We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election the report said U S spy agencies are charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions capabilities and actions of foreign actors the report said but do not analyze U S political processes or U S public opinion Pompeo was offering the president a reassuring political and false defense After a hue and cry arose the CIA walked back his claim As others have observed Pompeo is the only politician among the most senior national security officials secretaries of defense and state national security adviser and is quite comfortable with the president s operating style He runs the risk of undermining his and his agency s objectivity and its ability to tell the president hard uncomfortable truths  We ve also seen H R McMaster repeatedly provide cover for the president s mistakes e g giving the Russians code word intelligence and echoing Trump s bully boy tone Despite the efforts of those trying to spin the Iran deal decertification plan McMaster repeats the president s threats and bluster that we might just pull out of the deal presumably without our allies Is there a policy behind this or is it simply a political throwaway line He insists that complete denuclearization of North Korea is the only option creating a new red line and feeds Trump s hyperventilating  Frequent Trump critic Eliot Cohen has observed about McMaster s drift into the role of Trump cheerleader Having known liked and admired H R McMaster for many years I have to say what a terribly sad thing this is to watch On North Korea specifically he noted that McMaster s rhetoric is effectively a declaration of war If that is really true we are going to war in Korea and pretty soon Because denuclearization is not going to happen  It seems then that we have the worst of all worlds an excessive military presence in the highest echelons of our national security apparatus and an excessive degree of politicization which undermines the administration s waning credibility Trump really does bring out the worst in everyone 
https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2017/10/20/morning-bits-1173/	Does everyone become intellectually corrupted working in this administration CIA Director Mike Pompeo declared Thursday that U S intelligence agencies determined that Russia s interference in the 2016 American presidential election did not alter the outcome a statement that distorted spy agency findings His comment suggested falsely that a report released by U S intelligence agencies in January had ruled out any impact that could be attributed to a covert Russian interference campaign that involved leaks of tens of thousands of stolen emails the flooding of social media sites with false claims and the purchase of ads on Facebook Lawmakers should call him up to the Hill to ask about this  No one has debased the office like this one Americans have low expectations for the administration of President Donald Trump In fact few U S residents think President Trump s tenure will be remembered as a positive one Nearly six in ten Americans 58 believe Mr Trump will be remembered as either one of the worst presidents in the nation s history 42 or a below average leader 16 About one in five 19 think he will be considered an average president Just 18 say Trump will be thought of as either an above average president 11 or one of the best presidents in U S history 7  Expectations for tax reform sure have deteriorated Sen Roy Blunt R Mo said Thursday that Republicans don t have to make every desired improvement to the tax code this year but have to at least get the ball rolling  He s even devalued the honor of a call from the president Gold Star Mom Hits Trump on CNN They Should Put Someone Else in Charge of Condolence Calls Maybe put someone else in charge of the executive branch  Now chief of staff John F Kelly has sullied his own reputation When he accuses Rep Frederica Wilson of listening in on the call he makes it sound like she was surreptitiously eavesdropping on another receiver Wilson was in a limo with Johnson s family when the call came The call was put on speakerphone presumably at Mrs Johnson s request so that everyone else there could hear it too The family wanted Wilson to hear it apparently Most significantly it wasn t just Wilson who objected to Trump s tone during the phone call It was Johnson s own mother  The GOP has deteriorated to the point the country would do better without it Whatever his impact may be on the country or the world Donald Trump s presidency imperils the future of his party and there isn t a serious minded Republican in Washington who would tell you otherwise privately In the short term Trump s determination to upend the health care market his vague tax plan that s already unpopular an approval rating that can t crack 40 percent his exhausting and inexhaustible penchant for conflict all of it threatens to make a massacre of the midterm elections if you go by any historical marker In the longer term it s plausible to think that Trump s public ambivalence toward white supremacists along with his contempt for immigrants and internationalism could end up rebranding Republicans for generations as the party of the past Not just the past but of bigotry and meanness  The VP has also cheapened his office A group of House Democrats on Thursday urged Vice President Pence to reimburse taxpayers the cost of his travel this month to Indianapolis for an NFL game he abruptly left after players kneeled during the national anthem

https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2017/10/20/faith-leaders-need-to-shape-up/	President George W Bush s speech on Thursday left the political and media world buzzing about his indictment of what has become the quartet of Trumpian ideas nativism protectionism isolationism and xenophobia These are not so much ideas but ill conceived grievances embodied in slogans and impulses designed to stir white grievance in the United States In a compelling follow on document from the Bush Institute entitled The Spirit of Liberty At Home In the World authors Thomas O Melia and Peter Wehner build on the objectives Bush identified in his speech hardening our defense leading in the world committing to citizenship and restoring democratic institutions  I ll focus on the last restoring democratic institutions because of the authors candid assessment of religious leaders Evangelical Christian leaders who have become the core support for Trump and his bastardized nationalism should take notice The authors write that when religion uses politics as a cudgel religion suffers  Religious leaders cannot be silent on public matters After all many of the greatest advances in justice in American history including abolishing slavery and ending segregation were the result in part of religious involvement in politics But the manner and style of that involvement is key When religious leaders and institutions use their faith as partisan weapons in our political wars it undermines the credibility of their core work Sociologists have found that connecting organized religion to partisan political agendas has led to a rise in the nones meaning individuals answering none of the above when asked about their religious preference  Likewise when religious leaders become thinly disguised partisans our democracy suffers  Representatives of religious institutions who present themselves as authority figures on matters of faith and public life need to be much more careful about allowing themselves to be viewed as political operatives Religious faith should not be subordinated to partisan loyalties and political power The church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state but rather the conscience of the state Martin Luther King Jr said It must be the guide and the critic of the state and never its tool  One cannot help but think that they have in mind the legion of evangelical conservatives who boosted Trump to office and now shield him from criticism absolve him of all blame for the division he has created and fall silent when he is not honest truthful empathetic or kind They act as political flacks not religious leaders  Moreover Melia and Wehner challenge religious leaders as the Rev Martin Luther King Jr did with white Southern clergy in the civil rights era to play a more active role within their own communities in championing a more civil and constructive public dialogue Their recommendations are sound  They can do this by their teaching and by modeling how to debate public matters with conviction but also respectfully and without dehumanizing others They can explain why religious convictions are not at odds with religious toleration and point out why the latter is in the self interest of faith communities In this unusually polarized and fractious time faith leaders have unique influence with their congregants They can appeal for reconciliation rather than division and show that principled people can also embody magnanimity and a generosity of spirit  The damaging influence of misguided clergy who wrap themselves in sanctimony is actually worse than the authors state Religious leaders have encouraged religious bigotry see Roy Moore sought to exploit fear and stereotypes calling for transgender Americans to be thrown out of the country demonized the Muslim faith by whipping up fear of sharia law and of refugees from war torn states exhorted their flock to lawlessness e g refusing to recognize gay marriage and cheered exclusion refusal to provide services to LGBT persons mass deportation of illegal immigrants even dreamers As we have discussed they have become the shock troops in the culture wars feeding their congregants anger and playing to their sense of victimhood  The document put out by the Bush Institute demonstrates serious and sober reflection Its tone is elevated and entirely without rancor No portion is more important than its spotlight on religious leaders responsibilities and failings We hope that these leaders take the opportunity for teshuva literally return in Hebrew more commonly considered as repentance They may not have consciously played a destructive role in dividing the United States but their help in repairing our torn social fabric would be dearly welcomed

https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2017/10/19/this-is-what-a-president-sounds-like/	Former president George W Bush gave a speech today a bookend if you will to Sen John McCain s R Ariz address early in the week upon accepting the Liberty Medal Bush spoke in a tone and with substance so different from what we have become acclimatized to hearing that his address has provoked a huge bipartisan thumbs up as though the country collectively could say Oh that is what a president is supposed to sound like  Bush surely had President Trump in mind when he addressed conspiracy theories nativism incivility and more but I think it s safe to say his intended audience was the moribund GOP We have now seen the party he used to lead decline into passivity and pure partisanship again and again enabling Trump rather than rallying to American principles and looking to the c0mmon good We ve seen Republicans eschew governance in favor of divisive sloganeering One president like Trump is bad enough the acceptance of his inhumanity by one of the major parties is a tragedy and national emergency  Bush began with a global view noting a worldwide assault on liberal democracies  Parts of Europe have developed an identity crisis We have seen insolvency economic stagnation youth unemployment anger about immigration resurgent ethno nationalism and deep questions about the meaning and durability of the European Union  America is not immune from these trends In recent decades public confidence in our institutions has declined Our governing class has often been paralyzed in the face of obvious and pressing needs The American dream of upward mobility seems out of reach for some who feel left behind in a changing economy Discontent deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts Bigotry seems emboldened Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication  There are some signs that the intensity of support for democracy itself has waned especially among the young who never experienced the galvanizing moral clarity of the Cold War or never focused on the ruin of entire nations by socialist central planning Some have called this democratic deconsolidation Really it seems to be a combination of weariness frayed tempers and forgetfulness  He soon pivoted to the unique challenges America faces  We have seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty At times it can seem like the forces pulling us apart are stronger than the forces binding us together Argument turns too easily into animosity Disagreement escalates into dehumanization Too often we judge other groups by their worst examples while judging ourselves by our best intentions forgetting the image of God we should see in each other  We ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America We see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade forgetting that conflict instability and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism  We have seen the return of isolationist sentiments forgetting that American security is directly threatened by the chaos and despair of distant places where threats such as terrorism infectious disease criminal gangs and drug trafficking tend to emerge  Every Republican who endorsed Trump turns a blind eye to his unfitness or excuses his heinous language and conduct should feel shame upon hearing those words  Bush s recommendation is simple but hardly simplistic We need to recall and recover our own identity Americans have a great advantage To renew our country we only need to remember our values He s talking to you Republicans who ve forgotten what he rightly calls the American creed  Our identity as a nation unlike many other nations is not determined by geography or ethnicity by soil or blood Being an American involves the embrace of high ideals and civic responsibility We become the heirs of Thomas Jefferson by accepting the ideal of human dignity found in the Declaration of Independence We become the heirs of James Madison by understanding the genius and values of the U S Constitution We become the heirs of Martin Luther King Jr by recognizing one another not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character  This means that people of every race religion and ethnicity can be fully and equally American It means that bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed  There is nothing in his four basic recommendations hardening our defenses against external threats to democracy maintaining U S leadership in the world strengthening democratic citizenship and call ing on the major institutions of our democracy public and private to consciously and urgently attend to the problem of declining trust that Democrats of good faith should dispute They ll have differences in specifics When should we intervene internationally Which electoral reforms do we need but that is understandable and healthy  What is critical is that Bush has identified precisely the issues that must be addressed if we are to stave off Trump and Trumpism Democrats including ex presidents would be foolish not to embrace Bush s agenda and where possible work together After all we are all Americans who embrace the ideal of human dignity found in the Declaration of Independence and the genius and values of the U S Constitution as well as the commitment to equal rights and justice for all Americans It s the current president who doesn t get it but there is a solution several actually for that as well

https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2017/10/20/trump-makes-himself-john-kelly-and-everyone-around-them-look-rotten-yet-again/	President Trump had to have the last word He always does On Thursday evening after two days of controversy surrounding his call to the widow of Sgt La David Johnson and the remarkable appearance by Gold Star father and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly felt compelled to tweet The Fake News is going crazy with wacky Congresswoman Wilson D who was SECRETLY on a very personal call and gave a total lie on content Just about everything in the tweet was false so let s start from the top  Trump after being nagged by the media as to why he hadn t promptly sent condolences to four military families who lost sons in Niger claimed that other presidents didn t call Gold Star families untrue and dragged Kelly into it saying Barack Obama never called Kelly True but incomplete since Kelly sat at Michelle Obama s table at an event the former president hosted in honor of Gold Star families  Only after that scene did Trump finally decide to call Johnson s widow Myeshia Johnson who was in a car with Johnson s mother and family friend Rep Frederica Wilson D Fla She put the phone on speaker According to Wilson Johnson s widow Johnson s mother and even Kelly who said he had given Trump the line Trump told Johnson her husband knew what he was getting into when he signed up Trump came across as callous delivering the line whereas in Kelly s telling it was moving and reverential  Wilson went public to berate the president and castigate him for making Johnson s wife cry When cornered Trump does what he always does Lie He denied saying this is what he signed up for to Johnson He also claimed he had proof he didn t say it That was apparently untrue also  For another day controversy swirled and the White House was obviously getting nervous that the president was starting to look inhuman more so than usual So the White House did what it now finds useful sending out the only White House staffer who has a shred of credibility Kelly Kelly spoke nobly recalling with tremendous emotion his own experience learning of his son s death and solemnly related the process for notifying families  However for reasons that are not entirely clear Kelly then went after Wilson with a vengeance He didn t say she lied to the contrary he said Trump had delivered the line Kelly had recommended Rather he skewered Wilson for politicizing the call he was stunned he repeated and then falsely accused her of bragging at a ceremony dedicating an FBI building to two slain officers that she had gotten the money for the building That accusation was apparently untrue as well not to mention irrelevant The Miami Herald reported  Kelly criticized Democratic U S Rep Frederica Wilson for claiming she got the money for the new building during the 2015 ceremony while he and others in the audience were focused on the heroism of agents Benjamin Grogan and Jerry Dove killed during a 1986 shootout with bank robbers south of Miami  Thursday night Wilson said Kelly got the story flat out wrong In fact she said Washington approved the money before she was even in Congress The legislation she sponsored named the building after Grogan and Dove a law enacted just days before the ceremony  Kelly then went into a weird soliloquy  It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation absolutely stuns me And I thought at least that was sacred You know when I was a kid growing up a lot of things were sacred in our country Women were sacred looked upon with great honor That s obviously not the case anymore as we see from recent cases Life the dignity of life was sacred That s gone Religion that seems to be gone as well Gold Star families I think that left in the convention over the summer  Women were sacred I m unaware that women were once immune from sexual harassment in the workplace unless of course Kelly is recalling when women generally weren t allowed to work outside the house Some observers thought Kelly was slyly jabbing at Trump for attacking the Khans another Gold Star family or for Trump s own history of alleged sexual harassment and abuse It frankly sounded to me as though he was criticizing the Khans for weighing in on Hillary Clinton s behalf The spiel sounded like a campaign riff directed at members of the nostalgic Trump base who imagine some mythical time in our past when women were on a pedestal and religion was a more dominant factor in public life  And that is what brought us to Trump s tweet Thursday night  If you ve decided after revisiting all of this that everyone with the exception of the heroic Sgt Johnson his widow and his mother looks shabby you re not alone Trump apparently was trying to be nice but made the widow cry in his original call Rather than apologize and move on he spent two days lying dragging others into the mess and ultimately distracting attention away from the slain serviceman and three others killed in Niger  Kelly allowed himself to be used as a prop simultaneously drawing on sympathy for his loss of a son and opportunistically spitting political venom at Wilson The Post reported The appearance was an attempt to tamp down a self created and ballooning controversy over Trump s contacts with the families of fallen soldiers He didn t express remorse for any upset suffered by Johnson s wife or other family members because of the awkward call  As for Wilson she was telling the truth about the call but acting more than a little too gleeful in ratting out the president when attention should have been on the Gold Star families  Sometimes you just want the whole lot of them to go away  We ve grown sadly accustomed to watching Trump behave badly punching down at those who call him out The focus must always be on him the perpetual victim  Kelly s conduct was a sad revelation however and a reminder that while he looks upon himself as serving the country and he is he is also enabling a dishonest morally detestable politician As The Post reported There was evident irony in Kelly s making that particular point in defense of Trump whose presidential campaign last year was marked by name calling harsh rhetoric about Muslims Mexicans and other minorities and allegations of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women I would call it hypocrisy not irony He s after all standing next to and by someone who truly treats nothing people the truth democracy as sacred He s using his reservoir of honor and credibility to shield a president who is lacking both  Moreover Kelly s presence brings us back to the unprecedented number of military men turned civilian counselors in this administration Stocking an administration with generals diminishes the military by forcing revered figures to play politics and undermines the concept of civilian control especially in an administration in which the ex military and military advisers are taking adult day care shifts to mind an unfit president as Sen Bob Corker R Tenn memorably said  Our men and women placing themselves in harm s way and their families deserve better than the Trump crowd The country deserves honest civilian leaders Unfortunately like all Americans our fighting men and women are stuck with Trump and his reckless saber rattling for the time being   
https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2017/10/19/when-giving-himself-a-perfect-score-on-puerto-rico-isnt-the-nuttiest-part/	In a meandering self congratulatory news conference today in which he awarded himself a perfect 10 on Puerto Rico hurricane relief efforts keep in mind about 80 percent of residents still lack electricity and he dredged up a repeatedly debunked conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton and Russian uranium is the special counsel rattling him the weirdest part of President Trump s comments in the Oval Office concerned health care  Recall that he was for then against then for sort of the Alexander Murray bill to facilitate payment of health care subsidy payments also known as cost sharing reductions CSRs On Thursday Trump tossed out this word salad The Post reported  The president told reporters Thursday that while he prefers providing federal health finding in a block grant to states he is open to a different approach for a finite period   There will be a transition period so anything they re working on will be short term Trump said referring to Alexander and Murray It ll be absolutely short term because ultimately we will be it s going to be repeal and replace  The president has repeatedly decried the idea of paying money to insurers which is the way cost sharing payments are distributed   So I have great respect as you know for both of the senators that you mentioned and if they can come up with a short term solution he said without finishing the sentence What I did say though is I don t want the insurance companies making any more money than they have to  The bill has always been a short term solution so the only thing that has changed is Trump over and over again  He reportedly called Sen Lamar Alexander R Tenn at least twice on Wednesday More helpful to Alexander and Sen Patty Murray D Wash than Trump s contradictory meanderings are GOP co sponsors of which there are now a total of 12 with 12 Democrats more than enough to pass the bill if it comes to the floor  Alexander told his colleagues today This is a first step Improve it and pass it sooner rather than later Our purpose is to stabilize and then lower the cost of premiums in the individual insurance market for the year 2018 and 2019 He said pointedly Unless the CSRs are replaced with something else temporarily there will be chaos in this country and millions of Americans will be hurt He also made a point of relating that he told the president this was not an insurance company bailout but that the CSRs were designed to let low income Americans pay their premiums  Just a day ago Trump said he wouldn t do anything about the chaos he created by cutting off the CSRs today he has a different answer This is emblematic of a president who doesn t know what he wants what he is talking about or what is in legislation A Senate staffer wryly remarked that the staffer s boss didn t really know where the president stood It depends on the time of day the senator purportedly said Another frustrated staff member when asked if the president was now supportive of a congressional fix to the CSRs replied good naturedly Who the heck knows  That it seems is the best summation of Trump s entire presidency Good luck to the GOP getting tax reform done They ll need it
