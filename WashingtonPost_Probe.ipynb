Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that she doesn’t know if Trump warned chief of staff <span class=\"rollover-people\" data-behavior=\"rolloverpeople\">John Kelly</span> before bringing up his son in an interview.” F<em>or goodness sake, General Kelly, quit already. </em></p>, <p>Each time Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin speaks in public he is <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/18/mnuchin-tax-bill-markets-tank-243890\">diminishing</a> the chances of a tax bill. “So when you’re cutting taxes across the board, it’s very hard not to give tax cuts to the wealthy with tax cuts to the middle class. The math, given how much you are collecting, is just hard to do.” <em>Thunk</em>. It’s not hard at all, actually.</p>, <p>This senator’s stature is <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/lindsey-graham-on-trumps-military-family-kerfuffle-this-is-something-we-should-just-let-go/article/2637953\">shrinking</a> before our eyes as he tries to butter up Trump. “Lindsey Graham on Trump’s military family kerfuffle: ‘This is something we should just let go.'” No, instead let him and Graham explain why Trump is fit to be president.</p>, <p>He sure is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/10/18/the-sooner-rex-tillerson-resigns-as-secretary-of-state-the-better/?utm_term=.0e5c2743db0a\">lessening</a> the influence of the State Department. “Rex Tillerson comes across as a decent person with foreign policy preferences that are superior to the president. That does not matter anymore. He has alienated the White House, Congress, and the State Department. He has zero political instincts. Intentionally or not, he is eviscerating the diplomatic corps. He is in way over his head, and he needs to exit the stage as soon as possible.”</p>, <p>We should be <a href=\"http://www.crfb.org/papers/fy-2018-senate-budget-and-budget-gimmicks\">paring</a> down the debt, not expanding it. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget: “The United States faces serious fiscal challenges, with high and rising debt for the foreseeable future. Gimmicks make it difficult to take Congress’s commitment to fiscal responsibility seriously. The Senate budget is not fiscally responsible as it relies on gimmicks to artificially improve its numbers and contains very real reconciliation instructions that could add up to $1.5 trillion to the deficit.”</p>, <p>Whatever credibility and governing ability he has left is <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-signals-opposition-to-bipartisan-health-care-deal-1508338881\">decreasing</a> by the hour. “President Donald Trump on Wednesday sent a strong signal that he opposes a bipartisan deal on health care after earlier expressing support, sowing confusion and raising questions about the bill’s chances of success.” . . . “I am supportive of Lamar as a person &amp; also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co’s who have made a fortune w/O’Care,” Trump tweeted on Wednesday, referring to Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.).” Total ineptitude.</p>]\n",
      "[<p>The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/key-senators-reach-bipartisan-health-care-subsidy-deal-and-trump-expresses-support/2017/10/17/72be5b04-b355-11e7-a908-a3470754bbb9_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_senatehealth-3p%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&amp;utm_term=.f413a84f953c\">compromise from Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.)</a> would provide states with greater flexibility under the Affordable Care Act in exchange for authorizing cost-sharing reduction payments known as CSRs for two years. Those payments help offset deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for low-income consumers who obtain insurance under the ACA.</p>, <p>Trump insisted he’d been involved in crafting the deal. (Then Obamacare wasn’t dead?) Republican lawmakers, however, haven’t signed on since they’ve been touting their determination to destroy Obamacare, not to save it. On the other hand, if they don’t accept the Alexander-Murray deal (which Senate leadership squashed to push the Graham-Cassidy replacement scheme), they’ll be blamed for making insurance premiums even more costly and leaving more Americans without coverage. Welcome to the Trump era in which Republicans wind up contradicting themselves and holding the bag — and their noses — because the president is committed only to preserving his ego and claiming a win.</p>, <p>We might — get this — see the president demand Republican leadership move the compromise plan to the floor where “Chuck and Nancy” (Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California) can round up the votes needed to pass it.</p>, <p>In a critical sign of support, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told Chuck Todd Tuesday afternoon, “I’m very pleased that Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray continue to work so hard to try to stabilize the insurance markets, to lower premiums, and to provide some stability, which is really needed. This bill may not be perfect. I would have liked to have seen a specific authorization and some seed money for reinsurance pools, which would further help to lower premiums. But this is a good package, and I hope it will be passed very quickly so it can have an impact on rates this year.” She’ll need to bring a number of Republicans with her and prevail upon the majority leader to put it to a vote.</p>, <p>On one level this shows how entirely unprincipled and reckless have been the president’s actions. One day he’ll destroy coverage, the next he might spare it. The content of bills and their affect on actual people makes no difference to him. The current situation also speaks to the intellectual dishonesty and vapidity of Republicans who inveigh against Obamacare, cannot come up with a popular alternative and then would (in some cases) rather see vulnerable citizens hurt than fix some of the problems with the ACA and buy more time for further revisions.</p>, <p>Defenders of Obamacare and fierce critics of Republicans effort to kill it were delighted with the Alexander-Murray agreement. <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/person/andy-slavitt/\">Andy Slavitt</a> of the Bipartisan Policy Center and the former head of CMS praised the bipartisan effort to retain coverage in lieu of “partisan efforts which reduce coverage, cut Medicaid, and diminish patient protections.” He explained:</p>, <p>They have reached an agreement which preserves the ACA entirely while accomplishing three things. First, it undoes some of the harmful effects of the Trump Administration’s actions by restoring CSR payments and outreach funding for the next two years, although other harmful actions by the Administration also need to be addressed. Second, it provides new health plan options and added state flexibility while maintaining important consumer protections. And third, it represents a down payment on additional bipartisan reforms to increase the affordability of coverage for Americans.</p>, <p>In a similar vein, Schumer commended the agreement insofar as it “stabilizes the system” with two years of CSR payments. He suggested, “Our Republican colleagues seem to be in the opposite place on the long-term, but I think there’s a growing consensus that in the short-term we need stability in the markets.”</p>, <p>That’s the bitter pill Republican now will need to swallow — or not. Having failed to craft a workable GOP alternative to Obamacare, they might indeed have to keep it running until such time as they might come up with a feasible replacement. Considering what we’ve seen this year and their prospects for the 2018 midterms, “such time” may be never.</p>]\n",
      "[<p>One cannot but marvel at the contrast: A war hero, a veteran of the Senate who continues to serve despite a brain cancer diagnosis, admonishes the nation in eloquent terms to remember the values of a great country and extols it to live up to its highest ideals; meanwhile, a thuggish president vows to attack the war hero (as if anything he could do would matter to the man who survived the Hanoi Hilton), a know-nothing hack throws in her two cents and the State Department teeters into ruin. We have the promise of America vs. the current, rotten reality of this administration,</p>, <p><a href=\"http://time.com/4985185/john-mccain-liberty-medal-speech/\">Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.)</a> receiving a Liberty Medal graciously acknowledged a longtime colleague, former Democratic senator and vice president Joe Biden and expressed<em> his</em> own appreciation to a country he has loved so dearly he would endure unimaginable suffering to uphold its honor:</p>, <p>The most wondrous land on earth, indeed. I’ve had the good fortune to spend sixty years in service to this wondrous land. It has not been perfect service, to be sure, and there were probably times when the country might have benefited from a little less of my help. But I’ve tried to deserve the privilege as best I can, and I’ve been repaid a thousand times over with adventures, with good company, and with the satisfaction of serving something more important than myself, of being a bit player in the extraordinary story of America. And I am so very grateful.</p>, <p>What a privilege it is to serve this big, boisterous, brawling, intemperate, striving, daring, beautiful, bountiful, brave, magnificent country. With all our flaws, all our mistakes, with all the frailties of human nature as much on display as our virtues, with all the rancor and anger of our politics, we are blessed. . . . I am the luckiest guy on earth. I have served America’s cause – the cause of our security and the security of our friends, the cause of freedom and equal justice – all my adult life.</p>, <p>Who but McCain talks in such terms these days? Certainly no one in the White House. McCain then got to the meat of the speech:</p>, <p>To fear the world we have organized and led for three-quarters of a century, to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain ‘the last best hope of earth’ for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history.</p>, <p>We live in a land made of ideals, not blood and soil. We are the custodians of those ideals at home, and their champion abroad. We have done great good in the world. That leadership has had its costs, but we have become incomparably powerful and wealthy as we did. We have a moral obligation to continue in our just cause, and we would bring more than shame on ourselves if we don’t. We will not thrive in a world where our leadership and ideals are absent. We wouldn’t deserve to.</p>, <p>As he is compelled to do, President Trump, who was not mentioned in the speech, took umbrage and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/17/trump-to-mccain-i-fight-back-243861?lo=ap_a1\">threatened McCain with some unspecified action.</a> “At some point I fight back and it won’t be pretty,” declared the man who escaped war with “bone spurs.” As if to confirm his horrid self-absorption, he baited the press to check with Chief of Staff John F. Kelly to see if President Barack Obama called him when Kelly’s son was killed in battle. Surely, Trump is the most loathsome character to hold that office, a man undeserving of serving the country McCain described.</p>, <p>Kellyanne Conway, who invented “alternate facts,” then denied her boss practices the nationalism McCain described. She should check with him since he seems to embrace the term.</p>, <p>As all of this plays out, we should note, great and permanent damage is being done to the critical institutions that have worked, as McCain put it, to uphold “the international order we helped build from the ashes of world war, and that we defend to this day, [which] has liberated more people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history.”</p>, <p>Most visibly, we see daily evidence of the State Department’s demoralization and dysfunction, aptly described most recently by Jason Zengerle in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/magazine/rex-tillerson-and-the-unraveling-of-the-state-department.html\">New York Times</a>. By now the portrait is all too familiar — a disengaged and ineffective secretary of state who does not have the president’s confidence and who is preoccupied with downsizing (perhaps disabling) the department; a raft of seasoned diplomats throwing in the towel and retiring; a slew of unfilled political offices; and the head of policy planning, Brian Hook, so overwhelmed by day-to-day mishaps there is scarcely time for long-range thinking.</p>, <p>As to the latter, the portrait of R.C. Hammond, Newt Gingrich’s ex-attack dog, bossing around Hook, even lecturing him not to read materials from my colleague Dan Drezner is possibly the most pathetic scene that’s yet been described. Eliot Cohen, a former State Department official and vocal critic of both Trump and Tillerson, tells me, “It’s very odd to have a minder for a senior policy official at State being interviewed by a New York Times journalist,” He explains, ” It tells you something about the mistrustfulness and paranoia of this administration. For sure, though, it would have been a pretty ugly confrontation if the public affairs guy had tried to grab a book off my desk when I was Counselor and throw it away.” He adds, “Our guy, Sean McCormick, would never have done any such thing — and anyone in that position who had would have ended up with, at best, a sprained wrist.”</p>, <p>And there you have it: Do we want to be McCain’s America or Trump’s America? The country by electoral college (and with Russian help) chose the latter for now, but the fight for the soul of America is never over.</p>]\n",
      "[<p>A federal court judge in Hawaii on Tuesday struck down and barred implementation of the third iteration of President Trump’s travel ban (referred to as “E0-3” in the opinion). <a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2017/images/10/17/watson.pdf\">The court found:</a></p>, <p>Ignoring the guidance afforded by the Ninth Circuit that at least this Court is obligated to follow, EO-3 suffers from precisely the same maladies as its predecessor: it lacks sufficient findings that the entry of more than 150 million nationals from six specified countries would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States,” a precondition that the Ninth Circuit determined must be satisfied before the Executive may properly invoke [the immigration statute at issue, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f).</p>, <p>And EO-3 plainly discriminates based on nationality in the manner that the Ninth Circuit has found antithetical to both Section 1152(a) and the founding principles of this Nation.</p>, <p>In essence, the court found that the administration hadn’t done the bare minimum to justify its action. (“Under the law of this Circuit, these provisions do not afford the President unbridled discretion to do as he pleases. An Executive Order promulgated pursuant to INA Sections 1182(f) and 1185(a) ‘requires that the President find that the entry of a class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.'”) The court held that nationality alone could not satisfy the decision to bar a class of aliens. Indeed, the court suggested that EO-3 didn’t even pass a rationality test. (“Numerous countries fail to meet one or more of the global baseline criteria described in EO-3, yet are not included in the ban. . . . EO-3’s scope and provisions also contradict its stated rationale. As noted above, many of EO-3’s structural provisions are unsupported by verifiable evidence.”)</p>, <p>The court therefore concluded:</p>, <p>“The actions taken by the President in the challenged sections of EO-3 require him to ‘first [] make sufficient findings that the entry of nationals from the six designated countries . . . would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.’ . . . . Because the President has not satisfied this precondition in the manner described by the Ninth Circuit before exercising his delegated authority, Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim.</p>, <p>Wednesday morning a second court struck down the ban. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/second-judge-rules-against-latest-travel-ban-saying-trumps-own-words-show-it-was-aimed-at-muslims/2017/10/18/5ecdaa44-b3ed-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html?utm_term=.3e8e98a85dc3&amp;wpisrc=al_alert-COMBO-politics%252Bnation&amp;wpmk=1\">The Post reports:</a> “A federal judge in Maryland early Wednesday issued a second halt on the latest version of President Trump’s travel ban, asserting that the president’s own comments on the campaign trail and on Twitter convinced him that the directive was akin to an unconstitutional Muslim ban.” Once again Trump’s anti-Muslim rhetoric came back to haunt him. ”</p>, <p>Whether this ban wends its way up to the Supreme Court and is eventually implemented remains to be seen. However, what is clear is that immigrants from these countries pose little or no risk to the United States. No incidents have arisen this year from immigrants from the identified countries despite the on again-off again ban. What is clear is that it’s implementation is hurting national security. As <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/trump-travel-ban-chad-boko-haram-684078\">Newsweek recently reported</a>:</p>, <p>President Donald Trump’s decision to place Chad on his revised travel ban shocked experts and former U.S. officials who warned it could have major consequences for the fight against terrorism in Africa.</p>, <p>And it appears Trump’s controversial decision may have already damaged alliances on the continent—which is threatened by a range of militants, including affiliates of Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State militant group.</p>, <p>Chad has pulled hundreds of troops from neighboring Niger, where they had been stationed to assist in a regional fight against Boko Haram, the Nigerian militant Islamist group, Reuters reported.</p>, <p>As with each previous incarnation of the travel ban, EO-3 does great damage to the U.S.’s ability to coordinate the war against Islamist terrorism with little or no gain. In response to the second version of the ban, a long, bipartisan list of foreign policy experts <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/trump-travel-ban-weaken-national-security-foreign-policy-experts-566722\">wrote a letter </a>denouncing the ban. They argued that a travel ban would “<span class=\"a\">jeopardize our relationships with allies and partners on whom we rely </span><span class=\"a\">for vital counterterrorism cooperation and information-sharing. To Muslims</span><span class=\"a\"> including those victimized </span><span class=\"a\">by or fighting against ISIS </span><span class=\"a\">it will send a message that reinforces the propaganda of ISIS and other </span><span class=\"a\">extremist groups, that falsely claim the United States is at war with Islam.” They also ripped the notion that the ban was needed for national security purposes:</span></p>, <p><span class=\"a\">Following the 9/11 attacks, the United States developed a rigorous system of security vetting for </span><span class=\"a\">travelers to our homeland, leveraging the full capabilities of the intelligence and law enforcement </span><span class=\"a\">communities. Since then, the U.S. has added enhanced vetting procedures for travelers and has revised </span><span class=\"a\">them continuously. Our government applies this process to travelers not once, but multiple times. </span><span class=\"a\">Refugees are vetted more intensively than any other category of traveler. They are screened by national </span><span class=\"a\">intelligence agencies and INTERPOL, their fingerprints and other biometric data are checked against </span><span class=\"a\">terrorist and criminal databases, and they are interviewed several times. These processes undergo </span><span class=\"a\">review on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most updated and rigorous measures are applied, and any </span><span class=\"a\">additional enhancements can be added without halting refugee resettlement or banning people from </span><span class=\"a\">certain countries.</span></p>, <p>Their objections are just as true today.</p>, <p>In sum, the thrice-invalidate ban is injurious to our national security. The administration’s travel ban fixation stems from its compulsion to feed red meat to its base, to fulfill a misguided and unconstitutional objective. It should cease its counterproductive, entirely political effort that wastes taxpayer money, damages our relationships with partners in the war against Islamist terrorism and reinforces the conclusion that this administration is more interested in perpetuating xenophobia and its “blood and soil” rhetoric than in protecting Americans.</p>]\n",

      "[<p>The Trump administration’s economic ignorance at times seems like quackery. Unlike virtually every credible economic source and policy maven, it asserts that trade and immigration are bad, protectionism is good and gigantic debt doesn’t matter. It perpetuates long-ago debunked tax myths (e.g. tax cuts pay for themselves) and postulates ridiculous levels of growth from a plan that will increase the debt by trillions. But nothing quite tops the latest revelation.</p>, <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2017/10/17/internal-white-house-documents-allege-manufacturing-decline-increases-abortions-infertility-and-spousal-abuse/?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_manufacturingmemo-853pm-1%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&amp;utm_term=.7891451760be\">The Post reports</a>:</p>, <p>White House officials working on trade policy were alarmed last month when a top adviser to President Trump circulated a two-page document that alleged a weakened manufacturing sector leads to an increase in abortion, spousal abuse, divorce and infertility, two people familiar with the matter said.</p>, <p>The documents, which were obtained by The Washington Post, were prepared and distributed by Peter Navarro, director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy. They were presented without any data or information to back up the assertions, and reveal some of the materials the Trump administration reviewed as it was crafting its trade policy.</p>, <p>Navarro, a longtime opponent of free trade, has pushed for less nutty but nevertheless harmful positions such as tariffs on China and opposition to multi-lateral trade. The administration’s extreme positioning on the North American Free Trade Agreement certainly reflects Navarro’s handiwork, and so far has been <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nafta-freeland-lighthizer-round4-1.4358242\">soundly rejected by Mexico and Canada</a>.(“[Canadian] Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland accused the United States of deliberately trying to undermine the North American Free Trade Agreement, calling its list of unconventional proposals ‘troubling,’ CBC News reported. Her remarks came during a tense joint news conference as the fourth round of NAFTA talks wrapped up in Arlington, Va. … As Freeland delivered the rebuke of the U.S. approach, her counterpart U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer silently looked down.”)</p>, <p>On the tax front, the Trump administration’s assertions are routinely ridiculed, sometimes in embarrassing fashion. The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/us/politics/white-house-push-to-help-workers-through-corporate-tax-cut-draws-skepticism.html?_r=0\">reported</a>:</p>, <p>Mr. Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers said in a report released on Monday that reducing corporate taxes could raise average household incomes by as much as $9,000 a year. The top end of that estimate was based on work by a trio of researchers, and on Tuesday one of them, Mihir Desai of Harvard, said Mr. Trump’s team had misread the research. The actual income gain implied by his study, he estimated, would be $800.</p>, <p>To say that the administration lacks intellectual rigor would be gross understatement. It seems that the boss’s contempt for facts and willingness to misstate and distort reality to fit political objectives have set the tone for an administration run on hokum and fables. Instead, the impression among ordinary voters and tax gurus alike is that Trump is relying on big tax cuts for the rich and for corporations to justify his pitch that all this redounds to the benefit of the middle class. It’s supply-side economics on steroids.</p>, <p>Trump’s tax hype has disturbed many honest conservative policy wonks and economists. <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/452754/taxes-rich-gop-priority\">Ramesh Ponnuru of National Review writes</a>:</p>, <p>The problem with [the supply side] case is that it assumes a strongly positive effect of tax cuts on economic growth that does not appear to exist. Bill Clinton raised tax rates and the economy sprinted ahead. George W. Bush cut them and the economy limped. Barack Obama’s second term featured higher tax rates than his first one, and a better economy. This evidence does not prove that tax cuts are harmful. It is consistent with the possibility that tax cuts have a mildly positive effect that other factors can defeat. It is not consistent with the idea that it makes an enormous difference whether the top tax rate is closer to 30 or to 40 percent.</p>, <p>The supply-side argument itself implies that cutting tax rates has diminishing returns. Reducing the top tax rate from 70 to 50 percent, as the initial Reagan tax cuts did, meant that making an additional pre-tax dollar netted someone in the top bracket 50 cents instead of 30. The incentive to make that dollar was 67 percent higher. The House Republican plan, by cutting the top rate from 40 to 33 percent, would increase the incentive by just 12 percent.</p>, <p>Ponnuru reaches a conclusion familiar to Right Turn readers, namely that “the likely returns for the economy from cutting the top income-tax rates are modest. Neither the economic nor the moral arguments for doing so are compelling.”</p>, <p>Likewise, <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/publication/republicans-need-tax-principles-like-these/\">Michael Strain </a>of the American Enterprise Institute has thrashed the administration for cutting taxes for the rich rather than pursuing changes in the code to benefit middle- and lower-income taxpayers. <a href=\"https://world.wng.org/2017/10/cadillac_friendly_tax_plan\">Henry Olsen</a> of the Ethics and Public Policy Center also warns Republicans that the politics of their plan stinks:</p>, <p>This is because the plan’s immediate benefits heavily tilt toward corporations and the rich. Large corporations would get more than a 40 percent cut in their tax rates, from 35 percent to 20 percent. Smaller, privately held businesses would see a similar decline, from as high as 39.6 percent to 25 percent. Economists argue about the effect of these changes on the national economy, but the political import is clear: Combined with a proposed cut in the top rate on labor income from 39.6 percent to 35 percent, liberals will enjoy saying that the well-to-do will fare well under the GOP plan. . . .</p>, <p>The plan raises the lowest rate of tax from 10 to 12 percent, meaning some working-class workers will see a slight raise in their tax rates. Middle-income workers will at best see a modest drop in the tax rate they pay, from 15 to 12 percent. Compared with what the wealthy get right away, that’s small beer.</p>, <p>The plan’s authors point to a near doubling of the standard deduction most taxpayers take. However, the plan also eliminates the personal exemption all taxpayers currently take for each member of their household. If you have two or more children, the increase in the standard deduction is smaller than the amount of the exemptions you will lose. Taxes for big families may go up.</p>, <p>He also warns that doubling the standard deduction will lead to less itemizing and therefore the irrelevance of the mortgage deduction. “The result: Upper-middle-income families will see their taxes go up. Most people making less than $50,000 a year will see little or no change.”</p>, <p>His conclusion should be required reading for all Republicans: “Republicans have always suffered from the perception that they care more about the rich than the common man. Their tax plan might help the common man in the long run by increasing investment and business activity. But the current plan looks like a much better deal for the rich than for the average people who put Donald Trump in the White House. In politics, perception can quickly become reality. Republicans should deal with this problem before it’s too late.”</p>, <p>Unfortunately, with a Cabinet full of Goldman Sachs millionaires and billionaires, the administration doesn’t seem interested in hearing hard economic and political truths that might undercut self-serving arguments for tax cuts for the rich. Let’s just hope it doesn’t claim that tax cuts will lead to reductions in “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2017/10/17/internal-white-house-documents-allege-manufacturing-decline-increases-abortions-infertility-and-spousal-abuse/?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_manufacturingmemo-853pm-1%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&amp;utm_term=.7891451760be\">abortion, spousal abuse, divorce and infertility</a>.” We’re already suffering from crackpot overload.</p>]\n",
      "[<p>Individually they may not be a big deal. Even collectively they do not rival President Trump’s domestic and foreign policy demolition derby for the most pressing issues of our time. But Trump’s moral depravity and attack on democratic norms remain critically important, as does the pushback which is thankfully coming with more frequency and rigor than ever before.</p>, <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/10/18/totally-fabricated-trump-disputes-congresswomans-depiction-of-his-exchange-with-soldiers-widow/?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_johnson-828am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&amp;utm_term=.578e579aff7d\">The Post reports</a>:</p>, <p>The mother of a soldier killed in an ambush in Africa said Wednesday that President Trump “did disrespect my son” with remarks in a condolence telephone call.</p>, <p>Sgt. La David T. Johnson’s mother, Cowanda Jones-Johnson, told The Washington Post that she was present during the call from the White House on Tuesday to Johnson’s widow, Myeshia Johnson. Johnson’s mother also stood by an account of the call from Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) that Trump told Johnson’s widow that her husband “must have known what he signed up for.”</p>, <p>“President Trump did disrespect my son and my daughter and also me and my husband,” Jones-Johnson said.</p>, <p>Trump lashed back. He denied Wilson’s account in a Twitter message Wednesday. He said he had “proof” that the exchange did not go as Wilson had described. Trump did not elaborate, but the claim again raised questions about whether the president tapes calls and conversations.</p>, <p>Later Wednesday, Trump expanded on his denial.</p>, <p>Sgt. Johnson’s mother, his wife and Rep. Wilson all confirm that Trump was disrespectful, if not cruel.</p>, <p>“Wilson went on to say Trump “was almost like joking. He said, ‘Well, I guess you knew’ — something to the effect that ‘he knew what he was getting into when he signed up, but I guess it hurts anyway.’ You know, just matter-of-factly, that this is what happens, anyone who is signing up for military duty is signing up to die. That’s the way we interpreted it. It was horrible. It was insensitive. It was absolutely crazy, unnecessary. I was livid.”</p>, <p>“[His widow] was in tears. She was in tears. And she said, ‘He didn’t even remember his name.’”</p>, <p>Trump’s hideous lack of empathy and determination to lie when he’s caught behaving inappropriately cannot be allowed to pass. His word cannot be trusted, his conduct must be repudiated.</p>, <p><em>Principle</em>: <em>The country needs to collectively come to grips with Trump’s unfitness — and remember that voting for a miserable human being for president isn’t justified because he’ll sign a tax cut or appoint a judge. Those who have enabled him deserve our scorn. </em></p>, <p>Next, Trump has spent ridiculous amounts of time and effort to stir the pot on the NFL kneeling protests. The NFL has now officially decided to tell him to butt out. Commissioner Roger Goodell made clear the NFL will not require players to stand for the anthem.</p>, <p>“NFL executives and owners joined NFLPA executives and player leaders to review and discuss plans to utilize our platform to promote equality and effectuate positive change,” he said. “We agreed that these are common issues and pledged to meet again to continue this work together. Asked if the owner would demand players stand, he answered, “We did not ask for that.”</p>, <p>Trump threw a fit on Twitter, but once again Trump got stepped over and ignored by the NFL. (He was the failed owner of the New Jersey Generals of the now-defunct USFL.)</p>, <p><em>The principle</em>: <em>Trump isn’t going to tell people how to protest, or companies how to run their businesses. </em></p>, <p>Then there is his attack on the “disgusting” First Amendment. A Federal Communications Commission member and then the chairman (a Trump appointment) rebuffed the president. “The FCC under my leadership will stand for the First Amendment,” Chairman Ajit Pai said this week. “And under the law the FCC does not have the authority to revoke a license of a broadcast station based on the content of a particular newscast.” Even more emphatically, commissioner <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/15/media/trump-jessica-rosenworcel-nbc-license/index.html\">Jessica Rosenworcel over the weekend said</a>: “History won’t be kind to silence. I think it’s important for all the commissioners to make clear that they support the First Amendment, and that the agency will not revoke a broadcast license simply because the president is dissatisfied with the licensee’s coverage.”</p>, <p><em>The principle</em>: T<em>rump cannot trample on free speech, chill opposition and expect to be given a free pass. Indeed, his utterance(s) become part of the case for his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2017/10/17/sally-yates-needs-to-be-heard-more-often-on-trumps-unfitness/?utm_term=.12ab0db0b7be\">unfitness to hold office</a>.</em></p>, <p>And let’s not forget his grotesque conflicts of interest, self-enrichment and alleged violation of the Emoluments Clause. The Center for Responsibility in Washington was in federal court in New York today arguing to halt Trump’s receipt of monies received from foreign governments. In a press release following oral argument, CREW said that “the American people must be confident that the president is acting in our interest, not being influenced by payments from foreign governments, state governments, or the federal government.” The statement continued, “We and our co-plaintiffs Eric Goode, Jill Phaneuf, and the Restaurant Opportunities Center United are glad to have had the opportunity today to tell the Court why we are the right parties to bring this important case and why it is right and appropriate for the president to be held accountable for violating the Emoluments Clauses, which were intended to protect this country against the risk of significant corruption.” A decision is expected within 30 to 60 days.</p>, <p><em>The principle</em>: T<em>rump’s financial abuse of his office cannot become the new normal; if Democrats ever win the House the universe of his financial dealings (conflicts of interest, nepotism, emoluments receipt) can for the basis for impeachment, or at the very least, hearings with subpoena power.</em></p>, <p>Finally, new evidence arises every day suggesting the president is totally incapable of performing his duties. In a response to Trump’s on-again/off-again/sort of on-again support for the Obamacare compromise worked out by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor: “President keeps zigging and zagging, so it’s impossible to govern.” After recounting the contradictory statements in public and private Schumer said, “[Trump] doesn’t know what the bill is. We should have a President who actually knows the facts of bills that he talks about. . . . [H]he’s totally inconsistent. For it one day, against it the next day. You can’t govern, Mr. President, you cannot govern a country, you cannot keep America great if you don’t know what’s in the bills and don’t have a consistent policy about them. But he keeps zigging and zagging, our only hope it maybe tomorrow he’ll be for this again.” Shorter: He’s overwhelmed and unable rationally to perform his duties.</p>, <p><em>The principle</em>: <em>Trump may in fact be reaching the point at which the 25th Amendment becomes a consideration. In the future, we must never, ever elect someone as intellectually, temperamentally and morally deficient as Trump. He remains a menace to the country. </em></p>]\n",
      "[<p>President Trump’s decision to decertify the Iran deal followed by his threats to pull out (while senior officials contradicted him by insisting he wanted to remain in the deal) and a strong push back from the European Union have understandably left Democrats on the Hill and experts on both sides (some opposed, others supported) of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) somewhat dumbfounded. Just how is this thing supposed to work?</p>, <p>In a radio interview,  a crucial voice in determining the viability of his plan, ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee <a href=\"http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2017/10/16/ben-cardin-iran-kirkuk-somalia\">Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.),</a> underscored the predicament. He noted that Trump’s decertification was “met with disfavor” around the world and “makes it difficult for the U.S. to negotiate agreements” if our word is subject to constant revision. (Welcome to the Trump era.)</p>, <p>As for Congress’s role, he was emphatic: “We don’t want to do anything to violate the JCPOA.” In other words, Congress does not want to help Trump become the violator of the deal by imposing new or different conditions that are in conflict with the JCPOA. He was equally clear that it is up to the president to do the negotiating. “Congress cannot do this,” he said, dispelling the notion that the Congress could somehow negotiate with the EU on the terms of U.S. legislation (the Iran Agreement Review Act).</p>, <p>It’s not just Democrats who have raised objections. Critics of this approach include hawkish foreign policy gurus like <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/10/02/keep-the-iran-deal-attack-the-regime/\">Max Boot</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/iran-nuclear-jcpoa/542517/\">Kori Schake</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.house.gov/meetings/FA/FA00/20171011/106500/HHRG-115-FA00-Wstate-JeffreyJ-20171011.pdf\">James Jeffrey</a>.</p>, <p>In a somewhat different vein <a href=\"http://www.defenddemocracy.org/media-hit/senior-fellow-trump-throws-a-hail-mary-pass-against-iran/\">Reuel Marc Gerecht</a> underscored the problem with the strategy, calling it a diplomatic “Hail Mary.” He notes that the objective — to now contain Iran regionally and check Iran’s regional behavior — surely can be addressed outside the JCPOA, but the administration shows zero interest in doing so:</p>, <p>The White House says it wants to focus “on neutralizing the Government of Iran’s destabilizing influence and constraining its aggression, particularly its support for terrorism and militants.” “We will revitalize,” the administration promises, “our traditional alliances and regional partnerships as bulwarks against Iranian subversion and restore a more stable balance of power in the region.” But what does that actually mean? The administration has so far shown no interest in deploying more U.S. troops in the Levant and Iraq. The Syrian war has clearly shown that Sunni Arab states have no capacity, and really no will, to deploy ground forces against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, the foreign Shiite militias and Syrian armed forces under Iranian control, or Russian Spetsnaz and air power. The Iranian-Russian axis in Syria is on the and is taking more ground than American-aided rebels, most of whom are Syrian Kurds, who are not interested in taking on the Iranian-Russian axis.</p>, <p>Add to that the administration’s lack of concern about Iraqi-Kurdish military clashes, which leave Iran as the beneficiary, and it’s obvious we still do not have an Iran policy that is operational. <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/10/16/iraqi-kurdistan-clash-kirkuk-open-door-to-more-iranian-influence-slows-fight-against-islamic-state-isis-terrorism-middle-east/\">As one report explained</a>:</p>, <p>Iran has used the confrontation to deepen its involvement in Iraqi politics. Iranian-backed militias joined the troops Baghdad sent to Kirkuk, and reports emerged that the head of Iran’s Quds Force, Qassem Suleimani, was entering Kirkuk to hold talks with Iraqi Kurdish officials.</p>, <p>Some experts expect that the Iranian support for Baghdad in the fight over Kirkuk will rebound to Tehran’s benefit. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, forecast greater Iranian influence within the Iraqi government and greater popular support for Iran-backed candidates for Iraq’s elections, slated for next spring.</p>, <p>In short, rather than make a showy gesture in decertifying the Iran deal, which freaked allies and puts the U.S. on defense internationally, we could be doing the hard work of pushing back on Iran. But if that’s a no-go for this administration, what’s the point of also wrecking the JCPOA?</p>, <p>Gerecht also questions the premise, namely that Iran can be coaxed into giving up a whole bunch of concessions at a time the U.S. has little leverage (e.g. no international support, Iran’s economy revived):</p>, <p>[C]oncerning the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the chances of a new effective agreement are poor. Any good deal would actually “deny the Iranian regime all paths to a nuclear weapon,” as the White House stresses. This means, among other things, that the Section T concerns must be satisfied. We would have to imagine supreme leader Ali Khamenei and senior Guard commanders turning over the key physicist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh-Mahabadi and his colleagues and all of their paperwork to the International Atomic Energy Agency. They would have to allow the agency unfettered access to military sites. Imagining this scenario is to imagine the supreme leader being removed in a coup by guardsmen and clerics more stubborn than he. The “good deal” scenario imagines Khamenei betraying everything he holds holy. This only seems plausible if the regime is confronted with certain death.</p>, <p>Perhaps that has been the scheme all along. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) <a href=\"https://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=blog&amp;id=800\">has been candid</a> about his belief in a military option to be used against Iran:</p>, <p>Those who say this seem to believe we have only two choices: capitulation under the deal or years-long occupation after forcible regime change. Of course that’s not the case.</p>, <p>We always have the option of calibrated strikes like President Trump ordered against Syria earlier this year-indeed, we’ve used them to good effect with Iran itself. There was Operation Praying Mantis in 1988, when we destroyed or damaged half of Iran’s operational navy to retaliate for their mining the Persian Gulf. There was Operation Desert Fox in 1998, a four-day operation against Iraq, which also startled the ayatollahs. And it’s worth remembering Iran didn’t offer to suspend uranium enrichment until 2003, when we invaded Iraq. Throughout their history, the ayatollahs have consistently yielded to credible military threats.</p>, <p>And while the credible threat of military action may be all that’s needed to change the regime’s behavior, let there be no doubt about this point: if forced to take action, the United States has the ability to totally destroy Iran’s nuclear infrastructure<em>.</em> And if they choose to rebuild it, we could destroy it again, until they get the picture.<em><br/> </em></p>, <p>If that is the end game here, Congress should give the administration less, not more, leeway to move toward confrontation. Congress could, for example, require Congressional approval if sanctions are to be re-imposed (thereby putting the U.S. in breach of the agreement) and/or setting forth its position that the president must come to Congress for a memorandum for the use of force.</p>, <p>In short, Congress has no reason to trust this president and neither do our allies. Considering how entirely dysfunctional is our State Department, perhaps we should think less about regime change in Iran and more in terms of containing the U.S. president until he can be compelled to leave office (by election or otherwise).</p>, <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Gerecht clarifies that in fact he is in favor of dumping the JCPOA entirely. We have clarified above that he opposes the decertification strategy for different reasons than those who urge we remain in the JCPOA.</p>]\n",

As with almost everything in the United States, however, the poll reflects a partisan breakdown. “While 79 percent of Democrats and 66 percent of independents say harassment is a serious problem — both rising over 20 points in the last six years — this number falls to 42 percent among Republicans, little changed over that same period.” (In 2011, 38 percent of Republicans said harassment was a very serious problem). The Post’s pollsters tell me that among all conservatives, 51 percent say harassment is a serious problem in the United States. Among those who identify as very conservative, it’s 45 percent. And among conservative Republicans, 37 percent say it is a serious problem.</p>, <p>Hmmm. All of this occurs in the first year of a president whose boasts about sexual assault were captured on video and who racked up <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/all-of-donald-trumps-accusers-a-timeline-of-every-alleged-grope-and-assault\">a dozen or so</a> accusers claiming he sexually harassed or abused them, not counting several <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jtes/a-fifth-teen-beauty-queen-says-trump-visited-dressing-room?utm_term=.dhoGv5BR2#.hjeGmPrwX\">former beauty pageant contestants</a> (some of them minors) who accused him of bursting into their dressing rooms when they were naked or partially dressed. Trump has denied all allegations and said his “Access Hollywood” boasts were locker talk.</p>, <p>S<em>o how is it that 64 percent of Americans recognize sexually harassment is a serious issue and that the country nevertheless elected Trump?</em></p>, <p>Some Trump supporters would say that they didn’t believe any of the Trump accusers. That same skepticism apparently does not extend to Weinstein’s accusers, which suggests this might be a case of extreme confirmation bias. (<em>I like Trump, therefore these women have to be lying</em>.) Oddly, most if not all of the pro-Trump/anti-Weinstein crowd was entirely willing to believe Bill Clinton’s accusers. It’s almost as though we have a pattern: Right-wingers are just against <em>liberals</em> harassing women.</p>, <p>Another troubling conclusion is that Trump’s core supporters (very conservative voters and conservative Republicans) may not much care if women are harassed. Not even a bare majority of each of these groups thinks harassment is a serious problem. They might think women shouldn’t be in the workplace anyway. That’s not as improbable as one might think. <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/23/the-danger-of-president-pence\">The New Yorker reports:</a></p>, <p>At the White House, Pence has been hosting a Bible-study group for Cabinet officers, led by an evangelical pastor named Ralph Drollinger. In 2004, Drollinger, whose organization, Capitol Ministries, specializes in proselytizing to elected officials, stirred protests from female legislators in California, where he was then preaching, after he wrote, “Women with children at home, who either serve in public office, or are employed on the outside, pursue a path that contradicts God’s revealed design for them. It is a sin.” Drollinger describes Catholicism as “a false religion,” calls homosexuality “a sin,” and believes that a wife must “submit” to her husband.</p>, <p>Oh yes, you blue-state Americans, there are many Americans among the evangelical community, Trump’s strongest base of support, who buy that.</p>, <p>Alternatively, many of the very conservative and conservative Republicans may think that harassment reports in the hated mainstream media are untrue or exaggerated. And yet, they are filled with outrage over Weinstein’s and Clinton’s alleged conduct.</p>, <p>It’s hard to escape the possibility that Trump’s most devoted supporters aren’t very sympathetic toward harassment victims and tend not to give credence to them — unless they are attacking a liberal. If you think that level of hypocrisy is unimaginable, consider Pence and his wife’s handling of the “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/23/the-danger-of-president-pence\">Access Hollywood” </a>tape:</p>, <p>When the “Access Hollywood” tape surfaced, revealing Trump’s boast about grabbing women “by the [p–––y],” Karen Pence was horrified. According to a former campaign aide, Pence refused to take Trump’s calls and sent him a letter saying that he and Karen, as Christians, were deeply offended by his actions and needed to make an “assessment” about whether to remain with the campaign. They urged Trump to pray. When Trump and Pence finally did talk, Pence told him that his wife still had “huge problems” with his behavior. But in public Pence was forgiving, saying, “I am grateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people.”</p>, <p>You see they were offended, but not too offended to remain on the ticket and continue to vouch for a candidate whose grotesque behavior and language were unrivaled in modern American history. They — and their followers — were not going to let a whole lot of misogyny get in the way of political ambition.</p>, <p>Listen, if those who proclaim their own virtue <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-religious-right-carries-its-golden-calf-into-steve-bannons-battles/2017/10/16/53717dcc-b28c-11e7-be94-fabb0f1e9ffb_story.html?utm_term=.f64e12c62fb9\">will applaud Stephen K. Bannon</a>, cheer Trump’s hateful comments about Mexicans and defend any lie he tells, it’s not a stretch to imagine that they don’t give a darn about victimized women, unless it suits their political objectives.</p>]\n",
      "[<p>The latest CNN <a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2017/images/10/17/rel10b.-.trump,.guns.pdf\">poll</a> should be a wake-up call for Republicans. Among its findings: President Trump’s approval rating is at a dismal 37 percent, with his disapproval rating reaching 57 percent. It seems that core group, a third of most every poll, is the only segment of the electorate for which he and anything attached to him are not toxic.</p>, <p>A remarkably similar 34 percent approve of his tax plan, while 52 percent do not. Less than a third think the tax plan will improve the economy. And to make matters worse for Trump, 67 percent think he should release his tax returns, while only 24 percent do not. The safest vote for many members of Congress would be to vote for a requirement for Trump to release his taxes and against the Trump tax bill.</p>, <p>Just as Republicans attempted to tie President Barack Obama’s name to every policy they disliked (Obamacare, most especially) Democrats will soon figure out that “Trumpcare” and “the Trump tax plan” will set off alarm bells for a majority of voters.</p>, <p>However, since Trump does still command a relatively high degree of support (70 percent) from Republicans — although less than the 80-plus percent support that polls earlier in the year reported — his constant harping on the House and Senate GOP may explain why the Republicans’ generic congressional polling number is so atrocious. <a href=\"http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2017/images/10/17/rel10b.-.trump,.guns.pdf\">According to CNN’s poll,</a> 51 percent want a Democrat for Congress, while only 37 percent want a Republican.</p>, <p>The GOP nose dive now shows up in individual races. <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/house-overview/house-ratings-changes-12-districts-democrats-gain-momentum\">The Cook Political Report</a> tells us: “Based on recent developments in races and conversations with candidates and operatives on both sides of the aisle, many races have the potential to become more competitive. This week, we’re changing our ratings in 12 districts.” Spoiler alert: All are shifting away from Republicans. Cook now rates one GOP seat (retiring Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen’s seat in Florida’s 27th Congressional District) as leaning to the Democrats, 12 GOP seats as toss-ups and 23 GOP seats as only “lean Republican.” Put differently, of the 45 competitive seats, 36 are held by the GOP. If it loses 24, Democrats win the House majority.</p>, <p><a href=\"http://cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/are-republicans-going-get-pelosi-ed-2018\">Charlie Cook</a> quotes one Democratic strategist as saying Trump blames the GOP for his woes, which “has a ring of truth to voters because very rarely does someone criticize their own party. So in swing voters’ minds, it must have some truth because it is so abnormal.” Trump is thereby helping to undermine support for the GOP among the shrinking base of party regulars who still support the GOP House and Senate leadership.</p>, <p>To recap, Trump and policies linked to him are toxic with a large majority of non-Republicans. Meanwhile, his vilification of Republican leaders is helping depress their support among Republicans and in turn risking substantial losses in the House. As for the Senate, Trump’s ally Stephen K. Bannon is bent on running extremist challengers. He provides constant reinforcement for Trump’s rhetoric that members of the GOP “establishment” (i.e. incumbents) are no-good, incompetent swamp creatures blocking the Trump agenda. Two Senate seats (Nevada and Arizona) are already at risk of flipping, and with the announcement that Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) is retiring and popular Democratic ex-governor Phil Bredesen may run, Tennessee now becomes more competitive. With another GOP retirement or two and a goofy Bannonite winning a primary here and there, the Senate majority will be up for grabs. Democrats may not have a cogent agenda, but they have Trump, which may turn out to be all they need.</p>]\n"
